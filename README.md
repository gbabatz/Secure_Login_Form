# Secure_Login_Form
Final project of Security of Computer Systems Course, 9th semester, DUTH

In this implementation, we designed a Secure Login Form taking into consideration the vulnerabilities existing in such cases. Generally, we are protected from:  
* SQL Injection  
* XSS Protection (Cross Site Scripting)  
* Brute Force Attack  
* Insecure encryption at rest  
* Insecure encryption at transit
* Session Hijacking  

In the **Overview.pdf** file we describe each countermeasure taken and for which purpose(In Greek), as well as the logic diagram of our login page.  

In the **mysql_options.txt** file we show the commands used for the table creation in our MySQL Database.
