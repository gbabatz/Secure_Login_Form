CHANGES:

0) mysql: new table users_upgraded, same primary key 2 added columns check file for definition
1) restricted user updated
2) register.php check if email already exists before registering a user
(even though email is not primary key, its unique..we could add this but i did'not do that)
3) login.php save the ip of the user that wants to log in and set 1 at logged_in column
4) use email on session variable instead of username that was used on v3
5) session_auth.php retrieve the ip of the user that wants access to homepage.php
  if logged_in==1 and user has the same ip with the user that set the logged_in column to 1 then give him access. Also username is retrieved here. 
6) logout.php set logged_in==0 and delete session as usual.
7) style.css renamed to login.css
